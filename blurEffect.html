				<h1>Pure Css Frosted Glass Effect</h1>
				<p>So, yesterday I finished my recent work project and I started to wondered around, surfing on the web, suddently I got this idea in mind which is : how do we making an frosted glass effect with html and css ? hence this page got built.<br>As we know, there's nothing we can't do as mordern web-tech went on nowadays, so build a page only using html+css to achieve this effect should be walking in the park, but the point about this isn't to build it just that, it's all about to achieve it with the possible shortest method.<br>Now, let's get started !</p>
